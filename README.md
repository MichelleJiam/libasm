# libasm
42/Codam libasm, an introduction to assembly language

## Description
A small collection of basic functions rewritten in 64-bit ASM using Intel syntax. Compilation is done with nasm.

"bonus" functions consist of an assembly implementation of atoi_base (atoi with base parameter), with linked-list manipulation functions to be added later.

A main containing tests is included.

## Commands
Run ```make test``` to compile and see the list of test commands.

Run ```make bonus``` to compile with bonus functions.
